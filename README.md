# NumberPlate_Authentication_System

> First we will get around 700 images, will clean the images and will label them using labelImg and then we pass them into YoloV5 for NumberPlate Detection.

>After number plate detection, we do Character segmentation and then we do Character Recognition (OCR). 

>Then we do anthentication matching using Postgresql. 

>Then we create a dashboard in front end for managing the numberplates.

>Then we will deploy the project on front end.
