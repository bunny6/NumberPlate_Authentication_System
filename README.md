# NumberPlate_Authentication_System

Step 1 : Download images,clean the images and label them using labelImg and then we pass them into YoloV5 for NumberPlate Detection.

Step 2 : After number plate detection, we do Character segmentation and then we do Character Recognition (OCR). 

Step 3 : Third step is that we do anthentication matching using Postgresql. 

Step 4 : Fourth step, we create a dashboard in front end for managing the numberplates.

Step 5 : Final step, we will deploy the project on front end.
